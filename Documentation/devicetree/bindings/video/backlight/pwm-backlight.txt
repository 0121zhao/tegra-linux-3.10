pwm-backlight bindings

Required properties:
  - compatible: "pwm-backlight"
  - pwms: OF device-tree PWM specification (see PWM binding[0])
  - brightness-levels: Array of distinct brightness levels. Typically these
      are in the range from 0 to 255, but any range starting at 0 will do.
      The actual brightness level (PWM duty cycle) will be interpolated
      from these values. 0 means a 0% duty cycle (darkest/off), while the
      last value in the array represents a 100% duty cycle (brightest).
  - default-brightness-level: the default brightness level (index into the
      array defined by the "brightness-levels" property)

   The following fields are mutually exclusive  with "brightness-levels"
   and "default-brightness-level".It is used in case where levels are
   not available on the backlight device and the device can interpolate
   values.In this case the minium value that is considered is 0.

  - max-brightness: the maximum brighness value that is allowed by the
       backlight device.
  - default-brightness: the default brighness value that is allowed by the
       backlight device.

Optional properties:
  - pwm-names: a list of names for the PWM devices specified in the
               "pwms" property (see PWM binding[0])

Examples:

	backlight {
		compatible = "pwm-backlight";
		pwms = <&pwm 0 5000000>;

		brightness-levels = <0 4 8 16 32 64 128 255>;
		default-brightness-level = <6>;
	};

	backlight {
		compatible = "pwm-backlight";
		pwms = <&pwm 1 1000000>;
		max-brightness = <255>;
		default-brightness = <224>;
	};
